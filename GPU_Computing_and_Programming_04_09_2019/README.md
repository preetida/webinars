# SDSC Training: GPU Computing and Programming
## Tuesday, April 9, 2019, 11:00am to 12:00pm, PDT
## Presenter: Andreas Goetz

This webinar provides an introduction to massively parallel computing with graphics processing units (GPUs) on the SDSC Comet supercomputer. The use of GPUs is becoming increasingly popular across all scientific domains since GPUs can significantly accelerate time to solution for many computational tasks. In this webinar, participants will learn how to access Comet GPU nodes, how to launch GPU jobs on Comet, and get introduced to GPU programming. The webinar will cover the essential background of GPU chip architectures and the basics of programming GPUs via the use of libraries, OpenACC compiler directives, and the CUDA programming language. The participants will thus acquire the foundation to use and develop GPU aware applications.
